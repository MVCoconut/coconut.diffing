# Coconut Diffing Library

This library provides a platform agnostic diffing algorithm to render and update UI hierarchies, which can be used as a basis for creating coconut backends.

A proper documentation will hopefully be written some day. In the meantime, you may wish to examine the dummy backend included in the tests.
